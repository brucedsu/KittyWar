# Sprint 2 Plan

* Product name: Kitty War
* Team name: Dog & Koala Bear

## Goal

* Implement game logic and match-making.
* Construct a working interface that connects to the server.

## User Stories

### (10) As a back-end developer, I want a match-making system that matches two players with the same level of skills.

* (5) Ensure data is properly sent between client and server
* (2) Secure the connection between client and server
* (3) Incorporate logic that determines skill level

### (12) As a back-end developer, I need to implement the games logic (picking characters, drawing cards, using cards against the target) at the server side.


* (2) Implement the distribution of random chance cards
* (2) Implement the drawing of cards
* (3) Allow the player to target their opponent
* (5) Implement turn order
* (0) Have a good day

### (9) As a front-end developer, I need to use APIs provided by the server to send requests and receive responses. Then I make the front-end app update UI and internal data structures according to the returned data from the server.

* (2) Research Swift 3
* (2) Research TCP
* (5) Properly establish connection to the Database
* (0) Do your best

### (16) As a player, I want to log into a website and view my cards

* (5) Build webpage to display all of this data
* (2) Add chance cards to the database
* (3) Give the user their first 2 default cat cards
* (3) Give the user access to the 3 basic cards
* (3) Give the user access to the random lot of chance cards


### (13) As a player, I want to log into an iPhone app and view my cards
* (5) Build UI centered around signing in and displaying personal saved information
* (5) Ensure custom python server routes login data to database and authenticates the user
* (3) grant user access to their cards
